# 📊 AI Data Analyst with Visualisation

An intelligent data analyst app that uses **LangChain**, **Groq (LLaMA3)**, and **Plotly** to automatically analyze uploaded CSV files, generate meaningful insights, and visualize the data — all in a few clicks.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📁 Upload any CSV dataset
* 🧠 Auto-generates a concise **insights report** using LLaMA3 via Groq API
* 📈 Automatically generates and displays **4–6 visualizations** using Plotly
* 🔒 Built-in safety checks for execution of AI-generated code
* 💬 Built using **LangChain**, **Streamlit**, and **GROQ API**

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Python 3.9+**
* **Streamlit** – for building the UI
* **LangChain** – to structure LLM-powered workflows
* **Groq + LLaMA3** – as the core LLM provider
* **Plotly** – for rich, interactive data visualizations
* **dotenv** – to manage environment variables securely

## 🛡️ Safety Notes

The app includes safeguards to prevent generated code from:

* Reading local files (e.g., `pd.read_csv`, `open`)
* Redefining the DataFrame

## 📌 TODOs / Future Improvements

* Export insights and visualizations to PDF or PPT
* Support for Excel or Google Sheets
* Add user authentication
* Enhanced prompt tuning for better charts
